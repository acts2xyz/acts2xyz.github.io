I have had a blog up already, but I have been struggling to push the content faster and faster and more easily.

I know that I have been the one getting in my own way for YEARS.

I am overcomplicating things, when what I need is just raw consistency.

First I used Wordpress and I spent so much time tinkering with it.  I hated it.

then I tried Jekyll to host something for cheap on S3.  Good idea, I love the concept of a static site, it makes so much more sense to me.

But still -- very slow.  I know that I need to do better with this, and so still working on that path forward.

but I need to get started.

So today I am just writing things in Markdown using Obsidian, pushing them to a free Github pages and letting that go.

It will miss a ton of stuff, but I need to get started.
